Project Title: Predict Podcast Listening Time ðŸŽ§

This project, "Predict Podcast Listening Time," is a machine learning model designed to forecast how long a user will listen to a new podcast episode. By analyzing various features of a podcast and listener behavior, the model provides valuable insights for creators, advertisers, and podcast platforms.

The core of the project involves building a predictive regression model. The dataset, which can be custom-generated or sourced, includes features like episode duration, topic category, number of ads, and historical listener engagement data. The goal is to train the model to accurately predict a single continuous value: the predicted listening time in minutes.

The project is structured with a clear data pipeline. First, data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and feature scaling. Next, feature engineering is performed to create new, more informative variables. Then, various regression algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, are explored and tuned to find the best-performing model. Performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The final model is saved for future use.

This project is not just a technical exercise; it has real-world applications. For podcasters, it can help optimize episode length and content strategy to maximize audience retention. Advertisers can use the predictions to better target their ads and understand potential reach. Podcast platforms can leverage this model to improve their recommendation algorithms, suggesting content that users are more likely to engage with fully.

The code is well-documented and organized, with clear sections for data loading, model training, and evaluation. This makes it a great resource for anyone interested in time-series analysis, predictive analytics, and the growing field of audio-based data science.
